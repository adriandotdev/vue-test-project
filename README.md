### What I Learned from this project?
- Learned the Fundamentals of Vue.js such as v-directives, conditional rendering, and some of the basics of Composition API and Composables.
- Learned how to use QTable and how to modify it such as changing the colors, how to make a certain column sortable, and how to render a button component for each cell.
- Although the project must use the JSONPlaceholder data, I notice that the new added user or value is not really persist at the server, I also utilize JSON-SERVER for the data so that I can also implement AJAX request using Axios.
- Implemented the basics of HTTP Reqeuest (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE)
- Learned how to use other components such as QLoader, and QDialog.
- Learned how to setup basic routing.
